## Introduction
Welcome to my first game created in Unity! This project is a part of a bootcamp where I had the opportunity to dive into game development. I'm excited to share with you the results of my efforts and the skills I've acquired during this learning journey.

## Level Description
The game now has one level that I created to show what I've learned in the bootcamp.

## Asset Credits
I want to express my gratitude to Kenney, a fantastic resource for game developers. The assets used in this project, including the platformer kit, were sourced from [Kenney's Platformer Kit](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/platformer-kit). 

## Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to explore my first Unity game! This project represents the beginning of my game development journey, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this field. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed creating it.

Happy gaming!
